"""
EquallityLib offers ways to match "identical" chunks of text. 

Identical is in the eye of the beholder, so each can be turned on or off
by config settings.

Examples include:
- Ignore all whitespace
- python friendly "respect indent but ignore it inside brackets"
- Match C-style statements wrapped differently
- Ignore all comments
