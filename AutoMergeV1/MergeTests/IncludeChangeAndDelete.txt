So this is imperfect, but without external sanitisation (duplicate include
removal) this is the best we can get.

One side changed the include from ColourMapNumeric1DNode to ColourMapManager.
The other side added a new include - ColourMapManager.

The correct merge is to have two includes of colour map maanger.
